      <h1>A Student Flight</h1>
      <div class="veiw">
        <div class="box">
          Once upon a time, a lone balloon floated into the vast world—its
          delicate frame soaring like the dreams of a student embarking on a new
          journey.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          The streets stretched endlessly below, and the balloon drifted
          quietly, its fragile spirit dancing with the unknown, much like the
          student stepping out into life’s uncertainty.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          With each gust of wind, the balloon wavered, a reflection of the
          challenges faced. Yet, it never fell. Instead, it rose higher, buoyed
          by resilience, much like the student, who finds strength in victories,
          no matter how small.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          Each win, like a breath of fresh air, carried the balloon forward,
          gleaming with pride even in the dark corners of doubt.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          As it passed tall, glowing towers—symbols of hope, shining bright—the
          student saw in them the dreams he pursued.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          Yet beneath their golden light, shadows of doubt began to creep in,
          whispering, "Will I ever make it?" This fear weighed heavy on the
          balloon, just as it did in the heart of every student striving to
          succeed.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          For every balloon that rises to meet the sky must face the wind, the
          wear, the weight. It may falter, its journey brief and uncertain.
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          Yet, in its flight, both fleeting and radiant, it finds its purpose.
          It dances through the air, and though the path may be filled with
          twists and turns
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          it eventually finds its place in the endless light—just as the
          student, through perseverance and hope, finds their way in the
          vastness of life.
